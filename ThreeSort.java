// Create a ThreeSort class with a threeSort method and a main method.
// The threeSort method should contain the algorithm and the main method
// should be used for testing your algorithm. To make that easier, make the
// threeSort method static.

// Given three numbers as input, find the min, middle and max of the three.
// Return an array of the numbers in ascending order.
// Hint: to easily see your output, import java.util.Arrays
// and use the Arrays.toString(array) method to convert the Array to a string
// and then log it using System.out.println();
